                <h2>Mondstadt</h2>
                <h3>Nation of Freedom and the Anemo Achon</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    A city of freedom that lies in the northeast of Teyvat.
                    From amongst mountains and wide-open plains, carefree breezes carry the scent of dandelions — a gift from the Anemo God, Barbatos — across Cider Lake to Mondstadt, which sits on an island in the middle of the lake. Being watched by Barbatos, the God of the wind and the anemo element, Mondstadt can be compared to any medieval city, with a warmer and lighter atmosphere.
                </p>

                <h3>Nation of Contracts and the Geo Archon</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    A bountiful harbor that lies in the east of Teyvat. Mountains stand tall and proud alongside the stone forest, that, together with the open plains and lively rivers, make up Liyue's bountiful landscape, which shows its unique beauty through each of the four seasons. Ruled by Rex Lapis, the God of rocks, contracts and Geo element, Liyue is a place that resembles ancient China, with beautiful landscapes and festivals.
                </p>

                <h3>Nation of Eternity and the Electro Archon</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    An Isolated Archipelago Far East of Teyvat. Overcome endless thunderstorms and set foot on the islands of red maple and cherry blossoms. On winding shores and towering cliffs, and in forests and mountains full of secrets, witness the Eternity pursued by Her Excellency, the Shogun. Ruled by the Raiden Shogun, God of thunder and Electro element, Inazuma resembles also asian ancient times, being compared to old Japan, this is a place with sakura flowers spreading everywhere, and a rich culture, based on ancestrality.

                <h3>Nation of Wisdom and the Dendro Archon</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The city of scholars located in the west-central part of Teyvat. A fantastical nation of both lush rainforest and barren desert, where countless fruits of wisdom grow and are buried. Whether Travelers travel from afar through the forest to reach the academy city or delve deep into the desert to discover the historical ruins of the red desert, a wealth of valuable knowledge awaits them here. Ruled by both the Higher Lord Rukkhadevatta and Lesser Lord Kusanali, two parts of the same God of wisdom and Dendro element, Sumeru is a place with a never ending seek for knowledge, as long as a long lasting nature preservation, being constantly compared to Amazonia Forest.

                <br>
                <p>
                    A terrestrial sea in the center of Teyvat. Following the direction of pure currents, crossing wilderness, the depths of the forests and vastness of the sea of sand, arriving at the origin of all the waters of the continent. At the top of the waterfall, in the depths of the capital atop the terrestrial sea... a story that has never been heard, a legend that has been forgotten, like a lost kingdom sunken beneath the waves, yearning for a bard to sing its drowned songs. Ruled by Focalors, the God of justice and the Hydro element, Fontaine is a high society place, so to say. Culture, gastronomy and arts take full place here.
